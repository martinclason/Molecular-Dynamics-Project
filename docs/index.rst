Ale simulate
------------
Ale simulate runs the molecular dynamics simulation using classical mechanincs to evaluate 
the equations of motion for the system that is simulated. This does not limit the program 
to use only classical interatomic potentials in the simulations and it's highly encouraged 
to use the built in support to import interatomic potentials from openKIM which comes in a 
variaty of forms and is in most cases specific to the system that is simulated, which 
yields the best prediction of properties.
